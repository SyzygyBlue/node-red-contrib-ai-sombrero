  Template: mcpNode.hbs
  Purpose : Shape the final prompt sent by the MCP node so that the downstream LLM reliably
            returns routing decisions in strict JSON format expected by the routing engine.

  Inputs available to this template (injected by prompt-enhancer):
    • original      – The existing prompt assembled by the MCP node (contains message & outputs list)
    • instructions  – Extra user-supplied instructions (optional)

  Output: The fully-formed prompt string. Keep it compact but absolutely clear. Do **not** include
  markdown or commentary in the rendered output (it will be sent verbatim to the LLM).

You are a senior prompt engineer. Rewrite the ORIGINAL PROMPT below so that it:
1. Instructs the downstream LLM to output ONLY a JSON object in the form
   {"outputs": [<int indices>], "confidence": <0-1>, "reasoning": "<brief>"}.
2. Prohibits markdown or extra commentary.
3. Keeps any variable placeholders such as {{outputs}} and {{message}} intact.
4. Incorporates any additional user instructions provided.

Return ONLY the improved prompt text—no code fences, no JSON, no explanation.

{{#if instructions}}
User instructions to weave in:
{{instructions}}
