# Node-RED AI Project - Current Status

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a Node-RED module called `node-red-contrib-ai-sombrero` that provides AI-powered nodes for workflow orchestration, with a focus on the MCP (Multi-Component Processing) node and LLM connector functionality.

## Current State

### Completed Work
1. **Project Structure**
   - Set up basic Node-RED node project structure
   - Created MCP node with routing service
   - Implemented LLM connector with prompt enhancement
   - Added database configuration node
   - Set up testing infrastructure with Jest

2. **Key Components**
   - MCP Node with AI-powered and rule-based routing
   - Message enhancement pipeline with context enrichment
   - Modular UI components following project standards
   - Comprehensive test coverage

3. **Docker Setup**
   - Created Dockerfile for containerization
   - Configured persistent logging
   - Set up volume for data persistence

### Current Challenges
1. **Docker Installation Issues**
   - Difficulty installing the package via Node-RED's palette manager
   - Problems with package dependencies and build tools
   - Issues with file permissions and paths in the container

2. **Logging Configuration**
   - Logs not being written to the expected location
   - Limited visibility into installation failures

### Next Steps
1. Switch to WSL environment for better Docker integration
2. Rebuild the Docker image with proper build tools
3. Verify package installation and functionality
4. Test MCP node and LLM connector in Node-RED
5. Document usage and examples
