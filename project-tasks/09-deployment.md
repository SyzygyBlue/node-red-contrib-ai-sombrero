### Terraform Configuration
- [ ] Define infrastructure in code
- [ ] Support multiple environments
- [ ] Include state management
- [ ] Document provisioning process

## Containerization

### Development Environment
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile

  - Hot reloading
  - Debugging support
- [ ] docker-compose.override.yml for local development

### Production Environment
- [ ] Optimized Dockerfile
  - Minimal base image
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Non-root user
  - Health checks

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- [ ] Build and test
- [ ] Container image publishing
- [ ] Environment promotion
- [ ] Rollback procedure
- [ ] Deployment documentation

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Test coverage requirements
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Compliance checks

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- [ ] Prometheus configuration
  - Node-RED metrics
  - Custom application metrics
  - System resource usage

### Log Management
- [ ] Structured logging with labels:
  - workflow_id
  - node_id
  - task_id
  - component
  - environment

### Alerting
- [ ] Critical alerts (PagerDuty)
- [ ] Warning alerts (Email/Slack)
- [ ] Business metrics monitoring
- [ ] Alert documentation

## Security

### Secrets Management
- [ ] Environment-based secrets
- [ ] Vault integration
- [ ] Secret rotation
- [ ] Access control

### Network Security
- [ ] Network policies
- [ ] TLS termination
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] DDoS protection

## Operational Procedures

### Deployment Playbooks
- [ ] Standard operating procedures
- [ ] Rollback procedures
- [ ] Node restart procedures
- [ ] Emergency contacts

### Smoke Testing
- [ ] Automated smoke test flow (`/flows/test-smoke.json`)
  - Database connectivity
  - LLM provider access
  - Queue operations
  - MCP routing
  - End-to-end workflow

## Documentation

### Runbooks
- [ ] Deployment procedures
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Capacity planning

### API Documentation
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Rate limits
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Example requests

## Backup & Recovery

### Data Backup
- [ ] Database backups
- [ ] Configuration backups
- [ ] Message queue persistence
- [ ] Backup verification

### Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Recovery point objective (RPO)
- [ ] Recovery time objective (RTO)
- [ ] Failover procedures
- [ ] Data restoration testing
