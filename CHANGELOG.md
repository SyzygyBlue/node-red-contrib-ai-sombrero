# Changelog

## [0.3.3] - 2025-07-07
### Fixed
- MCP node now strips all Handlebars placeholders before sending prompts to the LLM, eliminating `{{message}}` echo issues.
- Added robust placeholder-regexes that tolerate extra whitespace and fallback to output labels when `aiLabelList` is empty.
- Added automatic removal of any stray `{{â€¦}}` tokens so the LLM never sees them.
- `routing-service.js` now always passes `response_format:{type:"json_object"}` when a provider supports it.
- Updated `ai-result-armor.js` to attempt recovery from truncated JSON and return `null` when no structure is found.
- Fixed AI decision map construction when labels contain spaces; guides recommend underscore-separated labels.
- Guarded rule evaluation crashes by clarifying recommended bracket-notation in docs.

### Added
- Debug log now shows trimmed prompt & response only after placeholders replaced.
- CHANGELOG entry for 0.3.2 omitted earlier releases; summarised under 0.3.3.

### Changed
- Package version bumped to **0.3.3**.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-04
### Added
- **Robust JSON extraction** in LLM Connector output processor using balanced-bracket scanning to reliably parse objects/arrays embedded in LLM responses.
- Recursive normalization of nested `choices/message.content`, `text`, and other wrapper fields.
