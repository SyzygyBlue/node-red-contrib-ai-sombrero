# Testing Strategy

## Unit Testing
- [ ] Set up Jest configuration
  - Code coverage thresholds
  - Test environment setup
  - Mock modules configuration
- [ ] Create test utilities
  - Test helpers
  - Custom matchers
  - Test factories
- [ ] Test coverage requirements
  - Helpers/Utils: 95% coverage
  - Services: 90% coverage
  - Nodes: 80% coverage

## Integration Testing
