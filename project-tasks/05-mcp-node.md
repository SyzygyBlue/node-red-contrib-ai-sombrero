# MCP (Master Control Program) Node Tasks

## Core Functionality

### Node Structure
- [ ] Create base node structure in `nodes/mcp-node/`
  - `mcp-node.js` (Manager file, <200 lines)
  - `mcp-node.html` (UI configuration)
  - `mcp-node-helpers.js` (Business logic)
  - `routing-service.js` (Routing logic)

### Routing System
- [ ] Implement dynamic output generation
  - AI-powered routing
  - Rule-based routing
  - Fallback mechanisms
  - Priority-based routing

### Message Processing
- [ ] Message enhancement pipeline
  - Context enrichment
  - Field transformations
  - Template processing
  - Validation and sanitization

### Configuration UI
- [ ] Intuitive UI in `mcp-node.html`
  - Route configuration
  - Rule builder
  - AI prompt editor
  - Debug mode toggle
  - Decision history

## Implementation Details

### Method Registry (mcp-node-helpers.js)
```javascript
/**
 * Method Registry:
 * - resolveRouting(msg, config)
 * - evaluateConditions(msg, rules)
 * - generateAIPrompt(payload, config)
 * - enhanceMessage(originalMsg, enhancementTemplate)
 * - logDecision(data)
 */
```
