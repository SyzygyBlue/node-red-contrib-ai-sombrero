# node-red-contrib-ai-sombrero
AI Sombrero is a plug-and-play orchestration toolkit for Node-RED that enables large language models (LLMs) to work together like a team of expert agents—each wearing a different "hat."

With support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and other LLMs, this project introduces:

Role-based LLM connector nodes that behave like software architects, project managers, or devops engineers—each with its own prompt stack and decision logic.

The MCP (“Master Control Program”) node—the Sombrero—which routes tasks intelligently to the right expert.

Persistent task queues, dead-letter recovery, and retry logic.

Modular backend services for databases, audits, queues, and AI integrations.

Built-in observability, testing, and CI/CD support for production-grade deployment.

Inspired by the power of prompt specialization and multi-agent coordination, AI Sombrero makes Node-RED a serious platform for composable, AI-assisted workflows and task decomposition pipelines.

Whether you're building autonomous task agents, document processors, or intelligent automation chains—put a hat on it and let the Sombrero drive.
